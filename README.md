## Projects

1. ### [Adult Income Prediction with Python](https://github.com/NatalieTran0203/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Projects/Adult%20Income%20Prediction.ipynb)
   This project uses supervised machine learning to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not given their demographic variation (age, education, gender, workclass, relationship, occupation,..) and demonstrating the practical application of some classification techniques in real-world scenarios to yield to the best prediction result.


2. ### [Analysis of an E-commerce with Python](https://github.com/NatalieTran0203/Data-Analytics-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Projects/Analysis%20of%20an%20E-commerce.ipynb)
